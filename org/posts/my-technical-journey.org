* Introduction
The year 2025 has been one of constant learning, experimentation, and building.
Throughout the months, I explored a wide spectrum of topics—from industrial
hydraulics to Linux customization, Nix packaging, Emacs automation, Docker,
robotics, and more. This post summarizes my questions, discoveries, and
projects across this entire year.

* Industrial Automation, Hydraulics & Plant Troubleshooting

** Diagnosing Hydraulic Systems
Early in the year, I worked through multiple hydraulic diagrams from injection
molding and die-casting machines. My questions focused on:

- Why pistons advance by themselves.
- Counterpressure issues during the return stroke.
- How to interpret complex hydraulic schematics easily.
- Which valves or cartridge assemblies should be inspected first.
- Understanding accumulator sizing and nitrogen requirements for 1600T machines.

These investigations helped me diagnose real plant failures with more clarity.

** OPC UA Connectivity
I explored how machines with built-in OPC Servers could share data with:
- third-party HMIs
- PLCs from other brands
- OPC UA clients

I also worked with Python OPC UA clients, GUI tools, and Docker-based setups to
run dashboards in the browser (localhost/IP).

* DevOps, Linux Systems, and Tooling

** NixOS and Linux Workflow Automation
Throughout 2025, I built a large ecosystem of scripts and tools:

- An all-in-one NixOS + Home Manager updater:
  - `nixos-rebuild switch`
  - `home-manager switch`
  - `nix flake update`
  - generation cleanup
  - interactive `fzf` menus
- A fuzzy package searcher using `allpackages.txt` + `fzf`.
- Scripts for encrypted storage:
  - Tomb on Linux
  - GPG-based vaults on Windows
- Integrating encrypted vaults with Fossil version control.
- Automatically launching Yazi tabs inside Zellij layouts.
- Detecting OS and adjusting behaviors dynamically.

These tools made my day-to-day Linux work more productive and standardized.

** Software Packaging & Compilation
I learned packaging and building custom software:

- Creating a Nix package for *The Dark Mod* game installer.
- Adding custom-built software to `configuration.nix`.
- Building and installing Emacs 31 from Git with:
  - tree-sitter
  - native-comp
  - mailutils
- Compiling utilities like `whdd` on NixOS.
- Writing xbps-src templates for Void Linux utilities.
- Handling Go installs and removals (`go install`, cleanup, etc.).

** Docker & Virtualization
I explored:

- Creating Dockerfiles to run Python-based OPC UA GUI clients.
- Running GUI apps inside containers accessible via browser.
- Debugging QEMU issues inside desktop entries.
- Handling special characters and line breaks in `.desktop` files.

* Emacs, Org-mode, Hugo, and Writing Automation

** Org-Hugo Website Workflow
2025 was a year of heavy Emacs + Org + Hugo experimentation:

- Managing my entire Hugo site from one Org file.
- Using `H1` headings as folder metadata for Hugo.
- Fixing image rendering issues and metadata in PaperMod/PaperModX.
- Customizing CSS to use JetBrains Mono on my site.
- Exporting pages correctly with empty `:HUGO_SECTION:` values.
- Solving agenda requirements:
  - weekly TODO view (only current week)
  - birthday calendar showing only the current month
- Improving my blog publisher to hide shell noise in Emacs.

** Package Experiments
I tried tools such as `org-social`, discovering:
- missing sync functions
- read-only relay buffers
- no usable backend for my workflow (yet)

* Robotics and Programming

** Robotics & Rapid
I asked for example code in RAPID for ABB robots and explored how Python ties
into robotic automation workflows.

** Python GUI Development
I worked with:

- Textual TUI apps (Hanoi project)
- pyqtgraph and PySide/Qt issues
- Importing missing widgets like `Slider` in new Textual releases
- Debugging graphical problems in GTK apps like Walker

** General Programming & Troubleshooting
Other topics included:

- Why `opcua-client` launches a terminal alongside the main UI.
- Name resolution for OPC UA endpoints.
- Cleaning and uninstalling Go-based binaries.
- Improving CLI and GUI ergonomics across Linux desktops.

* Linux Desktop, Wayland, Hyprland & UX Issues

I debugged and refined my desktop environments:

- Conflicts between mako and xfce-notifyd across sessions.
- Setting fonts correctly in browsers and mobile devices (Iosevka issues on iPhone).
- Wayland quirks with Hyprland and application compatibility.
- Zellij workspace design with automatic tab layouts.
- Launching Emacs with `emacsclient --nw -c -a ''`.

* Creativity, Logos, UI & Branding

I explored design work too:

- Creating formal industrial logos for a DieCasting maintenance group.
- Iterating to make them more complex, technical, and professional.
- Making my Textual TUI interface look more visually appealing.
- Exploring color schemes (Gruvbox Dark Material as baseline).

* Communication, Writing & Professional Emails

Throughout 2025, I also drafted multiple professional emails, including:

- Requests for hydraulic upgrades for a 1992 machine.
- Notes about obsolete components and modernization needs.
- Technical communication in both English and Spanish.

* Conclusion
2025 has been a year full of experimentation and growth:

- **Hydraulics + Industrial Automation**
- **Robotics + Programming**
- **Linux, NixOS, and DevOps**
- **Emacs, Org-mode, Hugo, and writing workflows**
- **Docker, OPC UA, networking**
- **Void Linux, Go, packaging, and compilation**
- **UI/UX, logos, and visual design**

Each question and challenge pushed me further as an engineer, developer, and
tinkerer. This year-long journey reflects exactly what I enjoy: learning,
building, and continuously improving the systems around me.
